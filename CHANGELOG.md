### Changed

### Added
- New npm scripts: `release`, `release:minor`, `release:major`, `release:dry-run`

### Fixed
- Fixed packaging script missing lib/, controllers/, core/, and services/ directories
- Fixed response cleaner incorrectly filtering valid translations containing "this is"
- Fixed inline translations extending beyond viewport boundaries
- Fixed translations constrained to word width instead of using full viewport

### Changed
- Dynamic version display in popup (reads from manifest)
- Response cleaner patterns now only match at line start (more precise filtering)
